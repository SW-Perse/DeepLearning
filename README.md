# Spam detector model using Tensorflow and neural networks
The purpose of this notebook is to build a spam detector able to identify spam text messages based on their content.
Specifically, natural language processing and neural networks were used to achieve this goal.
This notebook is my deep learning project for Jedha's Machine Learning Engineer certificate
